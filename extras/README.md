These are some extra scripts that I wrote. I don't promise they work.

* `dream2hdf` - wrapper for `util.dream2hdf` for cli usage. You need to install the python package `click`.
* `dakota_status` - Read a dakota output file and tell you what the current
                    evaluation number is. So you can keep an eye on runs.
